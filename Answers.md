1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`. 
Client-side routing is when javascript handles a client's routing. This is great because the page doesn't refresh and things are faster.
Server-side routing is when a page refreshes whenever you click on a new link, because there is a new get request that is fetching data from a server.
